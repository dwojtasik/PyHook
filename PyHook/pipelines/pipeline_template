# Optional numpy import from PyHook frozen bundle

# External (OS) modules have to be imported in 'with use_local_python() block'.
# Example:
# with use_local_python():
#     import module
#     import otherModule
#     from module import xyz
# IMPORTANT
# Create pip requirements file for additional modules to be installed
# Preferred name: "pipeline_file.requirements.txt"

# To fake modules e.g. for loading torch models with torch.load(...)
# use 'with use_fake_modules(fake_modules_dict) block'.
# This will map fake modules into sys.modules so they will be available
# in given code block.
# Fake modules dictionary has following structure:
# fake_modules_dict = {
#     "full.module.path": {
#         "some_var_or_func": 0
#     },
#     "other_module": {
#         "some_var_or_func": 0
#     }
# }
